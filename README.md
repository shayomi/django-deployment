# django-deployment
This blog was created using Django framework. Here the frontend is determined by the backend because
we are not installing djangorestframework.
There are few limitations to using djangoframework without djangoRestframework


# Requirements

For this project to function properly, one will be required to have access to 

  - A computer
  - IDE (Preferably Visual studios), Atom IDE can also be used
  - Basic HTML/CSS,JAVASCRIPT AND PYTHON knowledge
  - Internet connections


# Configuration

To properly use this program, A python environment must be created. I advice setting up Anaconda( a dsitribution for
packaging, managing and deploying programming languages). This can be used to set up your python environment by running in your terminal

 conda --version (to confirm the version installed)
 conda create --name 'environment name'
 conda activate 'environment name'
 
 # Installation

You can also setup  your djangpo framework by running the following commands in your terminal in your conda environment

  'python -m pip install django'
  'django-admin startproject (project name)'
  'python manage.py migrate'
  'python manage.py startapp'
  
 Once all these are installed, you should be good to go with running and using the program
 
 
# Troubleshoot & FAQ

In a case whereby you are unable to run this program , i will advice checking stackoverflow.com/django-rest
or message me directly on stevelegion94@gmail.com.


HAPPY HACKING
